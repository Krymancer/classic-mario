The game architecture actually is very simple:

- The js folder contais the source code
- The level folder contains the descriptions of levels in json's
- The sprites folder contains the descriptions of entities e.g: mario, koopas, gombas and etc.
- The sounds/music folder contains the descriptions of all music and sound to add in game
