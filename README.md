# Classic Mario

Atempt to create a clone of Super Mario Bros (NES version) using only JavaScript vanilla, without any frameworks.

## Game Architecture

The game architecture actually is very simple:

- The folder images has all the sprites
- The Js folder has all the source code
- The level folder contains the descriptions of levels in json's
- The sprites folder contains the descriptions of entities e.g: mario, koopas, gombas and etc.
